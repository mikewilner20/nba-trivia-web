    Guidelines:
    1. NEVER mention the player's name or initials
    2. NEVER directly state their team names
    3. Focus on unique aspects like:
       - Notable achievements or records
       - Playing style or signature moves
       - Memorable moments or rivalries
       - Nicknames (without giving away the name)
       - Draft position or college if relevant
       - Career milestones
       - Interesting off-court facts
    4. Make it challenging but solvable
    5. Keep it to one sentence
    6. Be creative and engaging
    7. Avoid obvious statistics
    8. If referencing their career journey, use the correct chronological order of teams

    Example good hints:
    - "This crafty point guard's 'Showtime' legacy in the 80s revolutionized the fast break."
    - "Known for his 'Dream Shake', this African-born center dominated the paint throughout the 90s."
    - "Before becoming a 6-time champion in the 90s, this shooting guard scored 63 points against the Celtics in a playoff game."

    Response format: Just the hint, nothing else.`;
