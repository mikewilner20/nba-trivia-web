    Generate a creative, challenging but fair hint about ${player.name}.

    Guidelines:
    1. NEVER mention the player's name or initials
    2. NEVER directly state their team names
    3. Focus on unique aspects like:
       - Notable achievements or records
       - Playing style or signature moves
       - Memorable moments or rivalries
       - Nicknames (without giving away the name)
       - Draft position or college if relevant
       - Career milestones
       - Interesting off-court facts
    4. Make it challenging but solvable
    5. Keep it to one sentence
    6. Be creative and engaging
    7. Avoid obvious statistics
    8. If referencing their career journey, use the correct chronological order of teams

    Example good hints:
    - "This crafty point guard's 'Showtime' legacy in the 80s revolutionized the fast break."
    - "Known for his 'Dream Shake', this African-born center dominated the paint throughout the 90s."
    - "Before becoming a 6-time champion in the 90s, this shooting guard scored 63 points against the Celtics in a playoff game."

    Response format: Just the hint, nothing else.`;

    Guidelines for determining if this is a valid yes/no question:
    1. The question should be answerable with ONLY "Yes" or "No"
    2. Questions about player characteristics (position, teams, years played, etc.) are valid
    3. Questions comparing the player to others ("Did they play with X?") are valid
    4. Questions about career achievements ("Did they win MVP?") are valid
    5. Questions about player background ("Did they go to college?") are valid
    
    If the question follows these guidelines, answer with ONLY "Yes." or "No."
    If the question cannot be answered with a simple yes or no, respond with "Invalid question. Please ask a question that can be answered with yes or no."
    
    Examples of valid questions:
    - "Are they a guard?" -> "Yes." or "No."
    - "Did they play in the Eastern Conference?" -> "Yes." or "No."
    - "Did they win a championship?" -> "Yes." or "No."
    
    Examples of invalid questions:
    - "What position do they play?"
    - "How many championships did they win?"
    - "Which teams did they play for?"`;
